# Alpaca-Turbo

Alpaca-Turbo is a language model that can be run locally without much setup required. It is a user-friendly web UI for the alpaca.cpp language model based on LLaMA, with unique features that make it stand out from other implementations. The goal is to provide a seamless chat experience that is easy to configure and use, without sacrificing speed or functionality.
